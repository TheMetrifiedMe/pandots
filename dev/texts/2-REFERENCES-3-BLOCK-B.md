## Rate of References to Covid-19 related Research

The second figure shows what portion of references of any item was itself about Covid19-related research. In the case of *Articles*, references to Covid-related research made up half the reference list since April 2020 if the citing article is itself about Covid-19 (blue line). Not surprisingly, if the citing article is itself not about Covid-19, it only rarely referenced research that is. In contrast, over 72% of the references made by Covid-19 related *Preprints* are themselves about Covid-19 rekated content.
