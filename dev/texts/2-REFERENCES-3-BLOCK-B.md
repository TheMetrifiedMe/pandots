The second figure shows the portion of references which are Covid-19 related. In the case of *Articles*, references to Covid-19 related research made up half the reference list since April 2020 if the citing article is itself about Covid-19 (blue line). Not surprisingly, if the citing article is itself not about Covid-19, it only rarely referenced research that was concerned about the pandemic, so that a 0.5% threshold is reached not before December 2021. In contrast, over 72% of the references made by Covid-19 related *Preprints* are themselves about Covid-19 related content in January 2022, marking the highest point overall.
