## Herfindahl-Hirschman Index
The first figure shows the Herfindahl-Hirschman values for the different genres and corona status. **A higher value means a higher concentration, a HHI of 1 means that there is a monopoly.**

All HHI values offer higher concentrations during the first months of the pandemic, sometimes even peaking in March 2020. Because the development of the HHI values is often the same for references to Covid-19 related and unrelated papers, it very likely that this statistic is substantially shaped by the denominator which is the production of papers. Almost all HHI levels decrease to ~0% of their maximum during the first year of the pandemic. However, references to preprints are the only notable exception. Over the whole window, there is a higher concentration among Covid-19 unrelated preprints than among those that cover the pandemic. While this is likely an effect of the smaller dominator, it could also mean that there were some more influential non-Covid related preprints, for example method papers.
