## Average Number of References per month

The first figure provides the average number of references per month, depending on whether the item is about Covid-19 (blue line) or not (green line). If *Articles* are chosen, one can see a small but constant increase, indicating that the number of references rises in general. In contrast, Covid-19-related articles had a much smaller but constantly rising reference count since the beginning of the pandemic. These dynamics are similar for the other items too. Notably, *Syntheses* revolve around 80 references per item which is the highest level.
