The first figure shows the absolute amount of publications (bars) and their average number of references (lines) per month, depending on whether a publication is about Covid-19 (blue) or not (green). 

The green lines with the average number of references made by Covid-19 unrelated *Articles* reveal a small but steady increase from 29.07 in February 2020 to 31.73 three years later in February 2023, which indicates the general bibliometric trend towards rising number of references. In contrast, the blue line suggests that the reference lists of Covid-19 related *Articles* grow stronger and at a higher pace, for instance from 19.59 in Febraury 2020 to 27.85 in February 2020. 

In contrast, *Syntheses* revolve around 80 references per item which is the highest level because review articles usually synthesize a lot of previous evidence and traditionally make more references than other document types (see also [Sigogneau 2000](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1005628218890); [Garfield 1977](https://garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v3p084y1977-78.pdf)).

The average number of references to Covid-19 related research is much higher for almost all genres during the first months of 2020. However, this is likely because of the low item counts during that time, as the blue bars suggest.
