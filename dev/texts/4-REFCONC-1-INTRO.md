# The Concentration of references
The data on this page tackles the question if the references of Covid-19 related research concentrate towards toward individual or a small group of papers. 

In general, citation distributions are heavily skewed that a small amount of items receives many citations while a majority receives only a few or none at all. The hypothesis is that this relationship may have been more severe during the beginning of the pandemic, so that only a handful of studies have been highly influential.

To reduce the number of dimensions and protect sanity, only the cited items are stratified here. **So all citing items are about Covid-19 and all their genres are combined.**
