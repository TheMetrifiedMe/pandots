## Genres in the Covid-19 evidence base

The first graph shows how Covid-19 related items cite other genres that are also about the pandemic. Similar to the production of items, there are visible yet more smooth dynamics during 2020. In sharp contrast, however, preprints are only marginally referenced with a maximum of 6% in March 2020 to a level that only once breaks 2.9% in Month 11 (November 2020). In contrast, *Problems* are the second most cited genre until Month 14 when they are overtaken by *Syntheses*. They reach their maximum in July 2020 (month 7) when they account for 19% of all references by Covid-19 related *Articles*! *Syntheses*, and *Problems* confirm this pattern so that one might ask whether the editorial discourse as part of the evidence-based of pandemic research has been highly neglected, especially in contrast to *Preprints*. 

But, if *Preprints* are selected as citing item, the dynamics are different. Here, preprints remain the second most important evidence-base until month 19 when they are overtaken by *Syntheses*. Therefore, especially *Preprints* seem to cite other *Preprints* while this effect disappears when they finally become journal publications. This might be because cited *Preprints* tend to be already published during the course of peer review. Or cited *Preprints* might get "weeded out" from the reference lists because they are seen as unreliable sources.
