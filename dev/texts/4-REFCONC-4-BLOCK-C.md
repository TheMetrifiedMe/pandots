These figures can be used to display auxilliary metrics, such as aboslute counts, rates of distinct items and different types of Kurtosis or Skewness. For example, the values for Skewness and Kurtosis show how the citation distributions are heavily skewed towards the left and with strong right tails. Such distributions are common in bibliometrics and can be described as lognormal, negative binomial or as other types of power law distributions [Thelwall 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1751157715301449). 

Kurtosis is used to describe where the weight of the distribution is located. Either many values concentrate close to the peak, or they are more evenly distributed towards the flanks of the distribution. With regards to citation data, such "flanks" could represent publications that are top ranked in their subfields, but not top ranked overall. However, there is no agreed-upon definition of Kurtosis and values are very sensitive to differences in sample size which are large in our dataset [see Cox 2010](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1536867X1001000311). *Note that median- or percentile-based (size-independent) definitions of skewness can be problematic for bibliometric data because they result in a division by zero if the the smallest value in the distribution accounts for 75% of the data which is commonly the case!*
