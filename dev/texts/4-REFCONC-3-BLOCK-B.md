The second figure shows the Gini-Coefficient of the same citation distributions as of the HHI. In contrast to the HHI which focuses on concentration, the Gini index looks at inequality. Usually, it would be very sensitive to items that receive zero citations. These are, however, not included in this set because the data is based on reference lists of citing articles which can never be zero. 

We can see the same pattern for all types: Covid-19 related publications distribute their citations in an increasingly unequal way during the first half of 2020. From the on, they become more dispersed so that the Gini is decreasing. Notably, the inequaltiy is always much higher when the cited item is itself about the pandemic (blue line). which indicates that there is a substantial amount of Covid-19 related publications that received only a little amount of citation.

### A reversed Matthew Effect?

The values for concentration (HHI) and inequality (Gini) suggest that the distributions of references differ by their Covid-19 relatedness. While there are many different Covid-19 related papers among the reference lists, there seem to be some central Covid-19 related publications which were cited more commonly. These could be single or a small set of highly influential publications. For example, publications might have cited Covid-19 unrelated research from their own (small) subdiscipline, but also cited a central and more general publication about the pandemic which gathered attention from many different biomedical subfields.

However, the dynamics of these measures are likely driven by the production of new items and are rather hard to interpret. Especially the Gini coefficient suggests how the citation inequality steadily decreases, probably due to a growth in citing items. The HHI seems to be more independent of size effects in general, but becomes similarly sensitive when te sample is too small, as in the case of preprints.
