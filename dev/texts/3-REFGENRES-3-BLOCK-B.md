## Citing other research
Corona-related research also cited unrelated research. The low rates of citations to *Syntheses* during the first five month indicate how Covid-19 unrelated research might have been cited for basic mechanisms or methods, but not for empirical results which are usually aggregated in systematic review articles. 


<!-- The comparative perspective, how Covid-19 unrelated research references different genres and pandemic content does not offer any dynamics and was excluded from the visualization. 

For non-Covid to non-Covid links, most citations go to other *Articles* (< 80%) and *Syntheses* (around 20%) while only fractions go to *Problems* and *Preprints*. It seems that it is highly uncommon to cite the editorial discourse or unreviewed material. This only marginally changes if other genres are selected. 

For non-Covid to Covid links, there are some dynamics. While the motivation for these references remain unclear (and might be also be partly due to missclassification in the data), it is noteworthy how especially *Problems* receive higher shares. This could indicate how publications about other topics refer to news or editorials when they refer to the Covid-19 pandemic in general. In addition, letters to the editor might have been used to criticise the methods and study designs of Covid-19 related research without discussing the content itself. *Note that the item-based calculations lead to erratic dynamics in the upper panel because the low number of overall items prohibits any smoothing effect.*
