For comparison, this section looks at the genre outputs of Covid-19 unrelated research. The grey bars reveal how around <2% of the overall dataset are published each month. The different shares draw a much more consistent picture of the overall publication output of Covid-19 unrelated research. But the monthly share is still lower in the beginning of the pandemic, e.g. with 1.79% in January 2020 (overall minimum), probably because researchers shifted their efforts to Covid-19 related research. Not surprisingly, research on the pandemic has cut into the regular stream of publishing.

The colored lines represent the share of the different genres and reveal common pattern for medical research. There is a majority of common journal *Articles*, >10% of *Syntheses* such as narrative or systematic reviews, and even less for editorial material or preprints. There are almost no dynamics among the genres besides the rise in preprints in month 33 (September 2022) due to the indexing of additional preprint servers by OpenAlex.
