  Types and genres of scientific literature serve different
  social and epistemic functions within the scholarly
  discourse. For example, medical researchers used preprints
  or the newly introduced rapid reviews to swiftly response
  to the Covid-19 pandemic. Such relationships allow to
  understand broader patterns and trends in science by
  studying the frequencies and dynamics of the different
  genres. With this data dashboard, we investigate the
  dynamics of <5 million medical studies that were published
  during the Covid-19 pandemic. Further, we ask what genres
  were used as evidence-base for Covid-19 related research.
